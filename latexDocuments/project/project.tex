\section{Multiple Problem Versions}
\label{sec:app}
%All versions should naturally build on top of each other
%? V1 should be pretty easy and reasonable
%? The last version can be moonshot - the idea is that you must implement
%for V1 first, then V2, etc. so as to guarantee some sort of finished build by
%the end of Week 10. If you can get to V2, V3, etc. by the end, great, if not,
%at the very least you have something done that you can present)
%Business Problem. Your main task is to explore the data and identify patterns of crime in Chicago, and come up with strategies to efficiently deploy your workforce to fight crime.

\textbf{Version 1}\\

The Municipal Capacities-Adjusted Disaster Risk Index is an innovative indicator for policymakers to make informed decisions about how to better preserve citizens\' well-being in the presence of real and potential threats. However, to be actionable, information needs not only to be available but efficiently delivered to communities, as a mean of protecting citizen\'s rights, foster economic growth, and make government officials accountable. 

As per its current state, official risk management information lacks a delivery system that enables local communities to improve their risk awareness and disaster coping capabilities in different scenarios marked for global phenomena such as extreme temperatures and changing weather patterns.
For instance, it is not apparent how similar events have impacted communities with different risk and vulnerability profiles, and there is no relevant information to assess the performance of risk management activities.  

%\begin{itemize}
%\item{There is no information available online wit the Disaster Risks panorama in Colombia}
%\item{The information available online about Disaster Risks in Colombia corresponds to Excel files, and to some reports created by the government with insights of the Disaster Risks panorama in Colombia. However, the information is not published in such a way that anyone can use to get easy-to-see information about the current risk state of a specific area. }
%\end{itemize}


\subsection{Question}

Based on the previously presented information different questions have arisen.

\begin{enumerate}


\item{In 2012, the National System of Risk Management was created in Colombia. Based on the available datasets is it possible to analyze and find patterns that show (\textbf{V3}),
\begin{itemize}
\item how does the risk map of Colombia changed after the creation of this system?
\end{itemize}
}


\item{There is a disproportionate impact of similar events among Colombia's municipalities, given by disparities in available infrastructure and first response resources  (\textbf{V2}).}


\item{Is it possible to analyze a specific event (disaster) and show how does the same event  affects different zones of the country? Based on that, we can analyze (\textbf{V1}):
\begin{itemize}
\item Are there factors that make some zones more vulnerable than others?
\item How does the specific infrastructure affects the impact of the specific event?
\end{itemize}
}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Datasets sourced }
\label{sec:app}

The main dataset used in the project is from the Colombia Risk of Disaster Management Unit (Unidad de Gesti\'{o}n de Riesgos y Desastres) UNGRD \cite{datasetUNGRD}. The dataset contains information about  the risk management associated with natural phenomena, socio-natural, technologic, and human-based non-intentional incidents reported in Colombia in the last 10 years (38626 records). Some of the fields found in the dataset are: Date, Department, Municipality, Event Name, Code, Dead, Wounded, Disappeared, Affected People, Affected Families, Affected Houses, among others.

The team will also use a dataset from the National Administrative Department for Statistics DANE. It is a time series between 1985 to 2020 and contains information, per department code about \cite{DANE} .

Both datasets contain ``DIVIPOLA'' codes, which is the codification of the Politica-Administrative Division of Colombia (Codification of the departments, ). Figure \ref{fig:divipola} describes the meaning of the code. The first two numbers correspond to the department, followed by the Municipality Code and the Populated Center [\cite{divipola}].

\section{Project scoping plan/proposal written}
\label{sec:app}

\subsection{Project scope}

\begin{itemize}
\item The Government Officials (at all levels) are our main stakeholders
\item Boundaries of the project:
\begin{itemize}
\item We do not offer forecasts or modeling/ infer data.
\item We only show metrics of impact of disasters at municipal level (not pin point to specific disaster event)
\item We do not offer recommendations, only do support to decision making process for the stakeholders.
\end{itemize}
\item Risks
\begin{itemize}
\item Data quality issues in the datasets 
\item The available data might be not enough to solve the proposed problem.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Project plan}

%\textbf{Problem}: The Municipal Capacities’-Adjusted Disaster Risk Index is an innovative indicator for policymakers to make informed decisions about how to better preserve citizens’ well-being in the presence of real and potential threats.
%However, to be actionable, information needs not only to be available but efficiently delivered to communities. As a means of protecting citizen’s rights, foster economic growth, and make government officials accountable.
%As per its current state, official risk management information lacks a delivery system that enables local communities to improve their risk awareness and disaster coping capabilities in different scenarios marked for global phenomena such as extreme temperatures and changing weather patterns.
%For instance, it is not apparent how similar events have impacted communities with different risk and vulnerability profiles, relevant information to assess the performance of risk management activities.

 %Impact is defined in terms of: Inhabitants affected/Thousand Inhabitants, percentage of households affected, Deceased/ Thousand Inhabitants.\\

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Expected Deliverable}:\\
To cope with the challenges stated before, our approach includes a dynamic map of Colombia delivering:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The impact metric (or metrics) at the municipal level for a given category of events. Ability to display complementary metrics of interest for specific locations (utilities, healthcare facilities, first-responder facilities, etc).
\item Considering the established association between extreme temperatures and the frequency of hydro-meteorological events, a projected extreme-temperature indicator for the 100 most vulnerable municipalities with 3 data points: Indicator value at Time 0 (1998), Time 1 (2018) and Time 3 (projected 2040)
\item The indicator corresponds to the extreme temperature projection made by Climate Impact Lab for the number of days a year that register temperatures above 32 degrees Celsius.
\end{enumerate}




\item \textbf{How do we get there?}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Get datasets, clean, wrangled, and analyze them.
\item Data modeling
\item Load the data in the cloud (RDS on AWS) and the instance (EC2) for hosting the back and front ends. Install and review the environment.
\item Make the back end: review databases, environment and set the code for running in the cloud
\item Make the front end : Interactive Colombian Map in Dash and tested on AWS.
\item Make the final presentation
\item Make the final report
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
