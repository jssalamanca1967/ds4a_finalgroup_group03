%? ?El Ni�o? and particularly the La Ni�a 2010-2011, which generated a national emergency situation never before seen in the country, affecting nearly 765 municipalities in Colombia, ?. After these phenomena, the government decided to improve the gathering information systems (info taken from

%\section{Project scoping plan/proposal written}
%\label{sec:app}

%\subsection{Project scope}
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The Government Officials (at all levels) are our main stakeholders
%\item Boundaries of the project:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item We do not offer forecasts or modeling/ infer data.
%\item We only show metrics of impact of disasters at municipal level (not pin point to specific disaster event)
%\item We do not offer recommendations, only do support to decision making process for the stakeholders.
%\end{itemize}
%\item Risks
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Data quality issues in the datasets 
%\item The available data might be not enough to solve the proposed problem.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{itemize}


%\subsection{Project plan}

%\textbf{Problem}: The Municipal Capacities’-Adjusted Disaster Risk Index is an innovative indicator for policymakers to make informed decisions about how to better preserve citizens’ well-being in the presence of real and potential threats.
%However, to be actionable, information needs not only to be available but efficiently delivered to communities. As a means of protecting citizen’s rights, foster economic growth, and make government officials accountable.
%As per its current state, official risk management information lacks a delivery system that enables local communities to improve their risk awareness and disaster coping capabilities in different scenarios marked for global phenomena such as extreme temperatures and changing weather patterns.
%For instance, it is not apparent how similar events have impacted communities with different risk and vulnerability profiles, relevant information to assess the performance of risk management activities.

 %Impact is defined in terms of: Inhabitants affected/Thousand Inhabitants, percentage of households affected, Deceased/ Thousand Inhabitants.\\

%\begin{itemize}
%\item \textbf{Expected Deliverable}:\\
%To cope with the challenges stated before, our approach includes a dynamic map of Colombia delivering:
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item The impact metric (or metrics) at the municipal level for a given category of events. Ability to display complementary metrics of interest for specific locations (utilities, healthcare facilities, first-responder facilities, etc).
%\item Considering the established association between extreme temperatures and the frequency of hydro-meteorological events, a projected extreme-temperature indicator for the 100 most vulnerable municipalities with 3 data points: Indicator value at Time 0 (1998), Time 1 (2018) and Time 3 (projected 2040)
%\item The indicator corresponds to the extreme temperature projection made by Climate Impact Lab for the number of days a year that register temperatures above 32 degrees Celsius.
%\end{enumerate}


%
%
%\item \textbf{How do we get there?}:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Get datasets, clean, wrangled, and analyze them.
%\item Data modeling
%\item Load the data in the cloud (RDS on AWS) and the instance (EC2) for hosting the back and front ends. Install and review the environment.
%\item Make the back end: review databases, environment and set the code for running in the cloud
%\item Make the front end : Interactive Colombian Map in Dash and tested on AWS.
%\item Make the final presentation
%\item Make the final report
