\subsection{AWS-hosted database}

Figure \ref{fig:er_model} shows the entity relationship model of the project. The information contained in the model is:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Disasters : information of disasters of Colombia from 1998 to 2017, with the following fields: date,  Colombian political division, number of disasters, death, injuries, missing people, families, houses, public and education services infrastructures and some economical  information. (table disasters)
\item Events: name and category of the event (table eventos)
 
\item Political division of Colombia (divipola): ID of division, subdivision and name of both (divipola table)

\item Population estimates: relates population by period, age groups, political division, id, and gender

\item Weather estimates:  weather information from 1990 to 2018 (minimal temperatures, maximal temperatures, precipitations) (tables: historico\_cond\_metereologicas, load\_mintemp, load\_maxtemp, load\_precipitaciones)	


\item Load tables: temporal tables for loading disasters, political division, population (tables: load\_disasters, load\_divipola, load\_populations)

\item Views: wv\_disasters (summary table for disasters). 

\end{enumerate}
