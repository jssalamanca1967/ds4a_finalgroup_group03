\section{Multiple Problem Versions (week 3)}
\label{sec:app}
All versions should naturally build on top of each other
? V1 should be pretty easy and reasonable
? The last version can be moonshot - the idea is that you must implement
for V1 first, then V2, etc. so as to guarantee some sort of finished build by
the end of Week 10. If you can get to V2, V3, etc. by the end, great, if not,
at the very least you have something done that you can present)
